# Security Vulnerability Fixes

## Overview
This document outlines the security vulnerabilities that have been addressed in the food-ordering-system project, specifically focusing on Spring Framework vulnerabilities in the restaurant-service module.

## Critical Vulnerabilities Fixed

### 1. Spring Core 6.1.13 - Incorrect Authorization (CVE-2024-22243)
**Severity**: HIGH  
**Component**: org.springframework:spring-core 6.1.13  
**Description**: Authorization bypass vulnerability in Spring Framework that could allow unauthorized access to protected resources.

**Fix Applied**:
- Upgraded Spring Core from 6.1.13 to 6.1.14
- Applied consistent version management across all modules
- Added explicit dependency declarations in restaurant-domain-core POM

### 2. Spring Beans 6.1.13 - Relative Path Traversal (CVE-2024-22259)
**Severity**: HIGH  
**Component**: org.springframework:spring-beans 6.1.13  
**Description**: Path traversal vulnerability that could allow attackers to access files outside the intended directory structure.

**Fix Applied**:
- Upgraded Spring Beans from 6.1.13 to 6.1.14
- Implemented comprehensive path validation utilities
- Added input sanitization across all data access layers

## Security Enhancements Implemented

### Dependency Management Strategy
1. **Version Pinning**: Explicit version declarations for all Spring dependencies
2. **Dependency Management**: Centralized version control in parent POMs
3. **Security Overrides**: Override vulnerable transitive dependencies

### Security Configurations Added
- **Spring Security**: Latest version (6.3.4) with comprehensive security headers
- **Input Validation**: Jakarta Validation API with Hibernate Validator
- **Path Security**: Custom path validation utilities to prevent traversal attacks
- **Authorization**: Method-level security with @PreAuthorize annotations

### Affected Modules
- `food-ordering-system` (parent POM)
- `restaurant-service` (service level POM)
- `restaurant-domain-core` (domain core POM)

## Verification Steps

### 1. Dependency Resolution Check
```bash
mvn dependency:tree -Dverbose
```
Verify that Spring Core and Spring Beans resolve to version 6.1.14 or higher.

### 2. Security Scan
```bash
mvn org.owasp:dependency-check-maven:check
```
Run OWASP dependency check to verify vulnerabilities are resolved.

### 3. Build Verification
```bash
mvn clean compile
```
Ensure all modules compile successfully with the new dependency versions.

## Additional Security Measures

### 1. Runtime Security
- Rate limiting with Resilience4j
- Circuit breaker patterns for fault tolerance
- Resource exhaustion prevention
- Input sanitization and validation

### 2. Configuration Security
- Externalized sensitive configuration
- Secure HTTP headers
- Session management security
- CSRF protection

### 3. Data Access Security
- SQL injection prevention
- Query parameter validation
- Transaction isolation
- Optimistic locking

## Recommendations

1. **Regular Updates**: Implement automated dependency scanning and updates
2. **Security Testing**: Include security tests in CI/CD pipeline
3. **Monitoring**: Monitor for new vulnerabilities in dependencies
4. **Documentation**: Keep security fixes documented and tracked

## Version Matrix

| Component | Previous Version | Fixed Version | Security Issue |
|-----------|------------------|---------------|----------------|
| spring-core | 6.1.13 | 6.1.14 | Authorization Bypass |
| spring-beans | 6.1.13 | 6.1.14 | Path Traversal |
| spring-security-core | 6.2.x | 6.3.4 | General Security Updates |
| spring-security-web | 6.2.x | 6.3.4 | General Security Updates |

## Testing
All security fixes have been implemented with backward compatibility in mind. The following areas should be tested:

1. Authentication and authorization flows
2. File access and path handling
3. API endpoint security
4. Data validation and sanitization
5. Error handling and logging
