- Extends: to inherit properties and methods from a class. 
  The class that acts as a parent is called a base class, and the class that inherits from this base class is called 
  a derived or a child class. 
  
  Mainly, the extends keyword is used to extend the functionality of a parent class to the derived classes.
  Also, a base class can have many derived classes, but a derived class can have only one base class because 
  Java doesn't support multiple inheritance.

- implements: to implement an interface. An interface consists only of 'Abstract Methods'. 
  A class will implement the interface and define these abstract methods as per the required functionality.
  Unlike extends, any class can implement multiple interfaces.
