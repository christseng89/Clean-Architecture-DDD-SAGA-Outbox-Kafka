26. Running Apache Kafka using Docker
docker compose -f common.yml -f zookeeper.yml up

https://zookeeper.apache.org/doc/r3.4.8/zookeeperAdmin.html#sc_zkCommands
https://nmap.org/dist/nmap-7.92-setup.exe

echo ruok | ncat localhost 2181

docker compose -f common.yml -f kafka_cluster.yml up
docker compose -f common.yml -f init_kafka.yml up // RUN Once only...

## Kafka manager
http://localhost:9000/

// Add Cluster => Cluster Name (food-ordering-system-cluster) / Cluster Zookeeper Hosts (zookeeper:2181) => Save

28. Implementing Kafka model generic module

### kafka-model> 
mvn clean install

### Stop Kafka
docker compose -f common.yml -f kafka_cluster.yml stop
docker compose -f common.yml -f zookeeper.yml stop

### Re-start Kafka //Restarts all stopped and running services.
docker compose -f common.yml -f zookeeper.yml up
docker compose -f common.yml -f kafka_cluster.yml up

### Docker compose stop vs down // https://nickjanetakis.com/blog/docker-tip-45-docker-compose-stop-vs-down#:~:text=The%20docker%2Dcompose%20stop%20command,any%20networks%20that%20were%20created.
- The docker-compose stop command will stop your containers, but it wonâ€™t remove them.
- The docker-compose down command will stop your containers, but it also removes the stopped containers 
  as well as any networks that were created. 

  docker-compose down -v //to remove all volumes too

### Docker compose up vs start
- docker-compose up, use up to start or restart all the services defined in a docker-compose.yml
- docker-compose start command is useful only to restart containers that were previously created, 
  but were stopped. It never creates new containers.
